Tasker
=============

This is a collection of my tasker profiles.

**Wifi**  
*Home_Wifi.rf.xml*  
I use the cell phone tower id as a trigger to turn on/off my wifi.

**Lost**  
*Lost.prf.xml*
A text sent to the phone with "lockdown passcode" (replace passcode) will set your pin and lock down the phone. Lastly the GPS location will be found and sent via a google maps link back to the phone number that sent the lockdown text.

**Missed Important Call**  
*Missed_Emer_Call.prd.xml*  
*Unsilence.prf.xml*  
If the phone is silenced and a phone call is missed from selected important contacts an automatic email is sent will instructions to reply "unsilence" and the volume will be restored.
